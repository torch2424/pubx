# pubx
Really simple pub/sub state management ðŸ“‹

# TBD

This is still tbd. But, this is currently used in [VaporBoy](https://github.com/torch2424/vaporBoy), and [WasmBoy](https://github.com/torch2424/wasmBoy)

# Description

A State management sytem based around passing events through pub/sub. Meant to be easy, and lightweight.

State will be a JSON object, where the state object keys are an json object. e.g publish('myKey', newKeyState) => this.state.myKey = newKeyState

state objects will have two properties:

value: The current value of the state

subscribers: Json object keyed by random subscriber Ids, that are equal to the callbacks assigned to them
